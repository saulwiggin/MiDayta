					<h1> How my data.me works </h1>
				<h1>1)</h1>
				<h4> GPRS Datalogging </h4>
				<p> www.my-data.org.uk can be used to store your data in the cloud. It uses a remote datalogging system which can be configured
					to log a wide range of sensor data such as temperature, pressure and alarms. These remote dataloggers are transmitted via a GRPS
					network.</p>

			<h1> My-Data.me: A configurable charting platform for manipulating sensor data in industrial environments </h1>
		<!-- 	<p> My-Data can be used in conjuction with dataloggers in the following examples. 
				You might find the solution to your problems amongst them. If this is the case the get in contact with Warwick Wireless to solve your communications
				problems. Subscriptions can be bought for the website through Warwick Wireless. This site acts as a cloud storage facility. It allows you to monitor business critical 
				processes such as equipment temperatures, pressures, timings to provide a safe working environment. The website allows a configurable 
				dashboard which charts you collected data and also allows you to manipulate the data. Site surveys are available where we can inspect the suitability of your plant in installing
				any systems listed below and a free trial of the is available. 
			</p> --><p>Your subscription to
				my-data can be used along with the dataloggers below to receive multiple sensor data from your areas in your production plant, for monitoring time variable signs 
				and for use in conjuction with GPRS mobile to receive SMS messages and emails when alarms are breached. My-data allows single or multiple 
				users working at a central control or in the field remotely to monitor data from your factory. It reacts to critical events in your industial workspace with a brisk email
				providing information of current system information and also monitoring when levels are within safe thresholds. The website can be adapted for your arduino, raspberry pi or
				any circuit board collecting data to act as a storage dashboard for displaying data in an attractive manor to publish to your friends. It provides huge storage capabilities and you can chart
				data over a long time period remotely. Special algorithms are employed which allow you to maniulate your data and display it using an attractive cutting edge
				visualisation library. The dashboard provides a nexus for many possible applications where below we have explained some of the current applications deployed 
				in the field.</p>

				<p> The data is transmitted from a power plant with multiple transmission points. Multiple transmission sites on

				<p> As transmission occurs on the GRPS network multiple mobile phone SMS's can be used to transmit alarms in the plant. The 
					Dataloggers run on GPRS and therefore can be used in conjuction with phones sending messages regarding specific alarms.
					Alarms are configured on the dataloggers or on the website for specific thresholds.</p>
